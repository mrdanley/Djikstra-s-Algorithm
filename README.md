# Djikstra-s-Algorithm

#Small project where I created a Java Digraph (directed graph) class to store city and road information and used Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest distances between cities along with other minor functions. The program is menu driven and the data structures consist of a Minheap for the Priority Queue, arrays to store the 'edges' and 'vertices', and a 2D array for the graph adjacency matrix.

#included is the city and road data required for loading vertices and edges into a graph
